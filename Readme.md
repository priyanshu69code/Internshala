To create a `Readme.md` explaining the code for extracting expiry dates from the given Pandas Series, you can follow the structure below. Each section should provide a brief explanation of the purpose and functionality of the code. You can use Markdown format to create the README file.

# Date Extraction from Pandas Series

This Python code demonstrates how to extract expiry dates from a Pandas Series of strings and convert them to a new Series of DateTime objects.

## Code Overview

### Importing Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import re
```

In this section, we import the necessary Python libraries: `pandas` for working with data and `re` for regular expressions.

### Given Series

```python
data = pd.Series(['BANKNIFTY03MAR2230900PE.NFO','BANKNIFTY10MAR2230900PE.NFO','NIFTY17JUN2216900CE.NFO','TATACHEM25FEB21500CE.NFO','ACC25MAR221800CE.NFO'])
```

We start by creating a Pandas Series called `data` with sample strings containing information, including expiry dates.

### Date Extraction Function

```python
def extract_date(string):
    if isinstance(string, str):
        match = re.search(r'(\d{2}[A-Z]{3}\d{2})', string)
        if match:
            return pd.to_datetime(match.group(1), format='%d%b%y').strftime('%Y/%m/%d')
        return None
```

This section defines the `extract_date` function, which takes a string as input, searches for a pattern (expiry date), and converts it to a DateTime format. The function returns the formatted date.

### Applying the Function

```python
time_data = data.apply(extract_date)
```

Here, we apply the `extract_date` function to each element of the `data` Series and store the results in a new Series called `time_data`.

### Printing the Result

```python
print(time_data)
```

Finally, we print the `time_data` Series, which contains the extracted and formatted expiry dates.

## Output

The code produces the following output:

```
0    2022/03/03
1    2022/03/10
2    2022/06/17
3    2021/02/25
4    2022/03/25
dtype: object
```

## Conclusion

This code snippet demonstrates how to extract and format expiry dates from a Pandas Series using regular expressions and convert them to DateTime objects. The extracted dates are then printed as a new Series.
